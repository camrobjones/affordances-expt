    - 30 mins"" [X]
    - GR Instr
        - "In this task, you will read short passages and rate how sensible the action described in the last sentence is in the context of the whole passage."
    - G&R catch [ ]
        - Be sure to read the sentences carefully. On some trials you will be asked to select a specific number. On those trials the correct response is to click on the number indicated.
    - MR
        - example -> practice [ ]
        -  warn them that there will be no more feedback and that the test will begin after they press the space bar.
        - I think it would be nice to have the screen tell you which response is which (though maybe it was there - from the instructions I was worried it wasnâ€™t).
